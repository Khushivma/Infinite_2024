Git Steps:

1. Create a working directory/folder under a Partition like D:/E:/ etc 
2. Move to the working folder using command prompt
3. Now create a git folder - Local Repo, by typing git init
4. observe the .git folder getting created with lots of sub folders and files (enable hidden items view to see the folder)
5. Now Create a Remote Repo at www.github.com
6. Sync both the local and remote repo by using the command
       git remote add <alias name> <remote address >
7. Next we need to track all the files/folders that we may have to send to the remote repo
      - git status ( gives the current status of the local Repo)
      - git add <file1, file 2> or all files (git add .)
8. Next we have to commit the tracked info by using
       - git commit -m "<meaningful message>"
9. The above enables complete staging with a commit-ish ID 
10. Now to move the committed info to the remote use
      - git push <alias name of the remote> <branch name>  
      git push origin master
11. Now observe the changes in the remote repo
12. Next you may want to edit the info (use edit option in the remote )
13. Commit the changes with a message
14. Now to get the latest info, we need to pull the details from the remote repo by using
        git pull origin master
15. See the changes in the local Repo
